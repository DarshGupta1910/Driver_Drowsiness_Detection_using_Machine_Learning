 [MRL Eye Data Set Link](http://mrl.cs.vsb.cz/eyedataset#:~:text=Therefore,%20we%20introduce%20the%20MRL%20Eye%20Dataset,%20the,suitable%20for%20testing%20several%20features%20or%20trainable%20classifiers.)

**In the dataset, we annotated the following properties (the properties are indicated in the following order):**-   **subject ID**; in the dataset, we collected the data of 37 different persons (33 men and 4 women)
-   **image ID**; the dataset consists of 84,898 images
-   **gender [0 - man, 1 - woman]**; the dataset contains the information about gender for each image (man, woman)
-   **glasses [0 - no, 1 - yes]**; the information if the eye image contains glasses is also provided for each image (with and without the glasses)
-   **eye state [0 - closed, 1 - open]**; this property contains the information about two eye states (open, close)
-   **reflections [0 - none, 1 - small, 2 - big]**; we annotated three reflection states based on the size of reflections (none, small, and big reflections)
-   **lighting conditions [0 - bad, 1 - good]**; each image has two states (bad, good) based on the amount of light during capturing the videos
-   **sensor ID [01 - RealSense, 02 - IDS, 03 - Aptina]**; at this moment, the dataset contains the images captured by three different sensors (Intel RealSense RS 300 sensor with 640 x 480 resolution, IDS Imaging sensor with 1280 x 1024 resolution, and Aptina sensor with 752 x 480 resolution)
